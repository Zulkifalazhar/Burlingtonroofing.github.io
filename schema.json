For a typical 2,000 square-foot home, a new roof can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000.  Materials: The most common type of roofing material is asphalt shingles, which usually cost between $100 and $200 per square. Metal roofs are also becoming increasingly popular, and they can range in price from $500 to $1,000 per square.  Size: The size of your roof is one of the biggest factors in determining the cost of a new roof. A smaller roof will obviously cost less than a larger one.  Type: The type of roof you have will also affect the cost."

Metal roofs have an especially long lifespan, sometimes lasting up to 100 years. Lifespan of roof also depends on installation and maintenance.  What are some common roof problems? One of the most common roof problems is leaks. Leaks can be caused by a variety of things, such as loose or missing shingles, cracks in the roofing material, or holes where pipes or other objects penetrate the roof.  Another common problem is structural damage, which can be caused by wind, hail, or heavy snow. Structural damage can weaken the roof and make it more susceptible to leaks and other problems. "

It is also important to clean your gutters and downspouts regularly to prevent debris from building up and causing damage.  If you live in an area that is prone to severe weather, it is important to take precautions to protect your roof. For example, you may want to install hurricane straps or anchors to help secure your roof in case of high winds.  You should also be sure to keep trees trimmed near your home to prevent branches from falling on your roof and causing damage. "
